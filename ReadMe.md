N_Queens-Problem
N Queens is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other, for which solutions exist for all the natural numbers n except for n=2 and n=3.

This problem is solved by three methods of Hill climbing algorithm.

Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing
It first examines all the neighbouring nodes and then selects the node closest to the solution state as next node.

Hill climbing with side way moves
To avoid staying stuck in a shoulder plateau, we allow hill-climbing to move to neighbour states that have the same value as the current one.

Random-restart-hill-climbing
It conducts a series of hill-climbing searches from randomly generated initial states until a goal is found.
